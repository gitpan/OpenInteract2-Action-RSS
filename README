INTRO: OpenInteract2::Action::RSS
========================================

This is an Action within the OpenInteract2 framework that will fetch,
cache, and parse XML feeds. The heavy lifting is done by XML::Feed so
it should work with RSS (0.91, 1.0, 2.0) and Atom feeds.


INSTALLATION
========================================

The standard:

 perl Makefile.PL
 make 
 make test
 make install


QUICK START
========================================

Step 1:

# Define the action type in your server configuration
# ($WEBSITE_DIR/conf/server.ini)

[action_types]
...
rss = OpenInteract2::Action::RSS

Step 2:

# Create an action in your package's conf/action.ini that gets the
# recent uploads to CPAN, overrides the title from the feed, uses the
# default display template, and caches the feed and results for three
# hours:

[myaction]
action_type  = rss
feed_url     = http://search.cpan.org/rss/search.rss
title        = Recent CPAN uploads
cache_expire = 3h

Step 3:

Profit!
